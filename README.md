# Mumble Discord Bridge

Mumble Discord Bridge is an open source Go application to bridge the audio between Mumble and Discord.

It was built with the hope that people can continue to use the voice application of their choice.

## Usage

Several configuration variables must be set for the binary to function correctly.
All variables can be set using flags or in the environment.
The binary will also attempt to load .env file located in the working directory.

```bash
Usage of mumble-discord-bridge:
  -discord-cid string
        DISCORD_CID, discord channel ID
  -discord-gid string
        DISCORD_GID, discord guild ID
  -discord-token string
        DISCORD_TOKEN, discord bot token
  -discord-command string
	DISCORD_COMMAND, the string to look for when manually entering commands in Discord (in the form of !DISCORD_COMMAND). Default "mumble-discord"
  -mumble-address string
        MUMBLE_ADDRESS, mumble server address, example example.com
  -mumble-password string
        MUMBLE_PASSWORD, mumble password, optional
  -mumble-port int
        MUMBLE_PORT mumble port (default 64738)
  -mumble-username string
        MUMBLE_USERNAME, mumble username (default "Discord")
  -mumble-insecure bool
        MUMBLE_INSECURE, allow connection to insecure (invalid TLS cert) mumble server (default False)
  -mumble-channel string
	MUMBLE_CHANNEL, pick what channel the bridge joins in Mumble. Must be a direct child of Root.
  -mumble-announce bool
	MUMBLE_ANNOUNCE, whether the bridge should post in the Mumble text chat when a new user joins the Discord voice channel (default "true")
  -mode string
	MODE, determines what mode the bridge starts in
  -nice bool
        NICE, whether the bridge should automatically try to "nice" itself (run with lower priority). (default false)
```

The bridge can be run with the follow modes:
```bash
   auto
       The bridge starts up but does not connect immediately. It can be either manually linked (see below) or will join the voice channels when there's at least one person on each side.
       The bridge will leave both voice channels once there is no one on either end
   manual
       The bridge starts up but does not connect immediately. It will join the voice channels when issued the link command and will leave with the unlink command
   constant
       The bridge starts up and immediately connects to both Discord and Mumble voice channels. It can not be controlled in this mode and quits when the program is stopped. This is the default mode.
```

In "auto" or "manual" modes, the bridge can be controlled in Discord with the following commands:

```bash
!DISCORD_COMMAND link
	Commands the bridge to join the Discord channel the user is in and the Mumble server
	Using this command while the bridge is in Auto mode will set it to Manual mode.
!DISCORD_COMMAND unlink
	Commands the bridge to leave the Discord channel the user is in and the Mumble server
!DISCORD_COMMAND refresh
	Commands the bridge to unlink, then link again.
!DISCORD_COMMAND auto
	Toggle between manual and auto mode
```
## Setup

### Creating a Discord Bot

A Discord bot is required to authenticate this application with Discord.
The guide below provides information on how to setup a Discord bot.

[Create a Discord Bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)

Individual Discord servers need to invite the bot before it can connect.

### Binary

Prebuilt binaries are available.

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/stieneee/mumble-discord-bridge/releases/latest | grep "mumble-discord-bridge" | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -qi -
```

### Docker

This project is built and distributed in a docker container.
A sample docker command can be copied from below.
This service command will always attempt to restart the service due to the `--restart=always` flag even when the server is restarted.
For testing purposes it may be best to remove the restart flag.

Replace the environment variables with variable for the desired mumble server, discord bot and discord server/channel.

```bash
# Sample for testing
docker docker run -e MUMBLE_ADDRESS=example.com -e MUMBLE_PASSWORD=optional -e DISCORD_TOKEN=TOKEN -e DISCORD_GID=GID -e DISCORD_CID=CID stieneee/mumble-discord-bridge

# Run as a service
docker docker run -e MUMBLE_ADDRESS=example.com -e MUMBLE_PASSWORD=optional -e DISCORD_TOKEN=TOKEN -e DISCORD_GID=GID -e DISCORD_CID=CID --restart=always --name=mumble-discord-bridge -d stieneee/mumble-discord-bridge

# Stop the service
docker stop mumble-discord-bridge && docker rm mumble-discord-bridge
```

### Mumbler Server Setting

To ensure compatibility please edit your murmur configuration file with the following

```bash
opusthreshold=0
```

This ensures all packets are opus encoded and should not cause any compatibility issues if your users are using up to date clients.

## Building From Source

This project requires Golang to build from source.
A simple go build command is all that is needed.
Ensure the opus library is installed.

```bash
go build -o mumble-discord-bridge *.go
```

## Known Issues

Currently there is an issue opening the discord voice channel.
It is a known issue with a dependency of this project.

Audio leveling from Discord needs to be improved.
